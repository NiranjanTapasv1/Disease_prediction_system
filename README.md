# Disease_prediction_system
ML Projects

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a multiple disease prediction model using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Tree. The goal is to develop a robust and accurate system that can predict multiple diseases based on relevant features.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`:** This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the machine learning models.

- **`models/`:** Here, you can find the saved machine learning models after training.

- **`src/`:** The source code for the disease prediction model is organized in this directory. You can explore individual algorithm implementations and the main script for training and evaluating the models.
